### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a full-stack software engineer who uses an innovative, organized, and determined mindset to improve the landscape of companies. Having moved up the ladder at a sustainable fashion tech startup by improving their marketing presence and affiliate partnerships, helping companies help the world is a passion of mine. I spend a lot of time theorizing solutions to problems, and, as a developer, I utilize this mindset to make lasting change from the ground up.

-I am currently building an automated business consulting platform called LEAF for small businesses that provides Supply Chain Spending, Digital Marketing, and ESG Metric Data Analysis and Recommendations for small businesses using inputted data and a web scraper (using Puppeteer).

Other Projects: 

ECOTONE: An affiliate ecommerce site for ethically and sustainably made clothing products with an ESG score of each project ðŸŒ±

STYLESWAP: A social media site that allows users to post pictures of their fashion styles and sell their secondhand clothing 

CLEAREAR: A web application that quizzes you on musical pitches and keys across various levels in a guitar-hero-like vision

THE LIBATION STATION: A web application that lets you search for drinks and their recipes based on key words and phrases
