### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a full-stack software engineer who uses an innovative, organized, and determined mindset to improve the landscape of companies. Having moved up the ladder at a sustainable fashion tech startup by improving their marketing presence and affiliate partnerships, helping companies help the world is a passion of mine. I spend a lot of time theorizing solutions to problems, and, as a developer, I utilize this mindset to make lasting change from the ground up.

-I'm currently creating a social media app that allows users to share fashion styles and buy/sell secondhand clothing ðŸ‘¯

-Check out my previous project, Ecotone: an affiliate ecommerce site for ethically and sustainably made clothing products with an ESG score of each project ðŸŒ±
